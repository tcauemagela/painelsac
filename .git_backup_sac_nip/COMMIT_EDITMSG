feat: Add automatic default spreadsheet loading functionality

Implement a system to automatically load a default spreadsheet while still allowing additional file uploads. Key features:

- Created data/default/ directory structure for default spreadsheet storage
- Modified app.py to automatically detect and load planilha_padrao.xlsx from data/default/
- Combines default spreadsheet with additional uploaded files seamlessly
- Added UI indicator showing when default spreadsheet is active
- Enhanced file processing details to show source of each file (default vs uploaded)
- Added .gitignore to prevent committing sensitive spreadsheet data
- Created comprehensive README with usage instructions

Users can now place a default spreadsheet that loads automatically on startup, with the option to upload additional files that will be merged with the default data.
